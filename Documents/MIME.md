## Metadata

In addition to their uses for representing arguments, argument templates, and networks of interrelated arguments, [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) could be used in MIME messages to provide [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) about other parts in multipart messages.

There exists a `Content-Description` header for providing text descriptions of parts. There could, in particular for content of type `multipart/related`, be a new MIME header, perhaps named `Content-Metadata`, to refer to other parts which serve as metadata for them. Additionally or instead, those parts providing metadata could use a new header, perhaps named `Content-About`, to refer to those parts which they describe.

> [!TIP]
> One could include metadata in one MIME message part to describe content in another part.

## Content Negotiation

Agent-driven or reactive [content negotiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation) is performed by algorithms in user-agents which choose among the possible variant representations. This is commonly performed using a server-provided list of representations and metadata about them.

One could provide these functionalities using MIME messages. Senders could indicate the availability of content in various formats and languages and online locations without having to include the content in MIME messages.

> [!TIP]
> One could include content in some formats and languages while providing recipients with means to obtain remote content in other formats or languages.

## Serialization and Deserialization

Traditional approaches to [serializing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) objects have tended to involve transforming object graphs into and from single formats, e.g., binary data, JSON, YAML, XML, or RDF.

Objects could, additionally, be serialized into and be deserialized from MIME messages. During serialization, algorithms could add parts to MIME messages, each part expressed using a format. During deserialization, interrelated message parts would be processed back into objects.

## Security

[Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME) enables security features for MIME messages such as [digitally signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) messages.
