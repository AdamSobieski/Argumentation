## Introduction

[Argument maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_map) are diagrammatic representations of the structures of one or more arguments. Argument maps are useful for representing and analyzing existing writings and for helping end-users to think through issues as parts of problem-structuring and writing processes.

## Diagram Formats

[Mermaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid_(software)) is a popular technology for generating diagrams from text descriptions. Its MIME type is `text/vnd.mermaid`.

## Discussion

Brainstorming, assuming that one could (e.g., using large language models) generate natural-language arguments from argument diagrams and argument diagrams from natural-language arguments, end-users would be able to use content-authoring tools to view both of these representations simultaneously and to modify either to observe artificial-intelligence systems modifying and updating the other accordingly.
