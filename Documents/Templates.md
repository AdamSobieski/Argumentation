## Text

There are a number of text templating systems, e.g., [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), [Liquid](https://liquidjs.com/), and [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/). For including these templates in multipart MIME messages, Handlebars templates have a content type of `text/x-handlebars-template`, Liquid templates `application/liquid`, and Jinja templates `text/jinja`.

## Markup

Markup-based template technologies include [Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT). For including these templates in multipart MIME messages, XSLT has a content type of `application/xslt+xml`.

## Knowledge Graphs

With respect to knowledge-graph templates, there exists [Reasonable Ontology Templates (OTTR)](https://www.ottr.xyz/).

## Multipart MIME Messages

Coming soon.

## Advanced

Advanced topics in templating include interactive templates and agentic templates.

Interactive templates are templates with accompanying forms or questionnaires which end-users or agents could complete to produce outputs, e.g., computational representations of arguments.

Agentic templates resemble scripts, including [prompts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering), for artificial-intelligence systems to contextually produce natural-language arguments with accompanying structured knowledge.
